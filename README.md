# Web-Scraping
The purpose of this project is to scrape data from a online used car portal and performing analysis on the data acquired.

## Motivation
My attention was drawn to what the average consumer has to go through when looking for a used car to purchase.
Where do they go? Which make can be trusted? What is the average price to pay per brand?
The motivation of this project is to conduct EDA to derive meaningful insights for the consumer

Analysis of used car data can potentially offer savings of time and money for the customer
